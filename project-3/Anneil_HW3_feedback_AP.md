Q3.3 - The question probably wasn't the most clear, but it was looking for you to calculate the odds ratio (OR) of attending a #1 ranked school vs not attending a #1 ranked school. It would've been simply putting the odds of one over the other: 1.17/.38 = 3.07
Q3.4 - This built on Q3.3: For students who attended a top ranked college, the odds of being admitted into graduate school are 3.07 times the odds of students who did not attend a top tier school
Q3.6 - This was looking for the Odds Ratio of being admitted vs not-admitted given prestige 4. (12/55)/(114/216) = .41. For students who attended a 4th tier school the odds of being admitted into gradauate school are 0.41 times the odds of students who did not attend a 4th teir school.
Q5 - If you take a look at the last four elements of your dataframe (combos.tail()): Given the same GPA and GRE scores, students who attended a tier 4 undergraduate school had a 37% probablity of being admitted into grad school, while student who attended a tier 1 school had a 73% likelihood of being admitted into grad school.

Some links to help you get a sense for timeseries decomposition:
(http://www.cbcity.de/timeseries-decomposition-in-python-with-statsmodels-and-pandas) - This includes a brief IP notebook to help you implement code.
(https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/02/time-series-forecasting-codes-python/) - Quite a bit of material in this one. But I've read other topics on this blog and tends to be very good. 

Other elements worth considering: 
Try to see if you can get a hold of discount information to try to match it with the current time series you have now.
If you have the data, could it be worth considering the words that were used in the paid ad spot? Does using certain wording make the spend more effective?

Spot on with the exploratory analysis. Just be sure to add in some commentary on what you are observing with each box plot, corr matrix, and how seeing those things is impacting the way you're going to approach your problem. 
Another thing that will help is to use some markdown cells to insert nice titles and subsection descriptions to make it look nice and polished. Here are some great examples of other people's notebooks for inspiration: http://nb.bianp.net/sort/views/
Also, when I was staring at your data for ideas on new ideas of approaching your challenge, I felt I had no idea what some of the variables were. Perhaps a data dictionary (a table of variable names and their descriptions) in the beginning might be useful to help the audience understand all the available data.

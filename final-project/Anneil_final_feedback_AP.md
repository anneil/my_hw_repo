**Notes:** <br>
- Great job on this model, glad that you were so successful in figuring out how 2016 will be. <br>
- As we had discussed before, there are such few observations going into the model, can you think of ways your company can track more data point or greater intervals instead of just monthly? <br>
- Can different time intervals make a better model? See if youâ€™re boss would be willing to record more granular data.

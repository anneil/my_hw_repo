Sounds like you are aiming for a tool to support marketing spend decision making based on predicted demand/conversions. 

For instance, the question to your first proposed project reads 'Predict Amount to Spend on Paid Search' when 
it should perhaps read: 'Predict reservations resulting from amount spent on paid search'. You may get more valid results 
when distinguishing among different paid search strategies (assuming you vary keywords, etc). 

Do you think you should also factor in complementary promotions such as the discounts in project #2?

What's your plan for capturing seasonal effects in the data? This would probably start with defining what 'season' means in your context.

I find the vacancy prediction question quite interesting. There is probably also a complementary 'rental period' question that you'd need to answer to impact the impact on lost profits. 

In any case, be careful to account for various levels of discounts that shorten the vacancy period. 

I think you can try a range of methods, take a look at this paper by Bajari (et al) who is also Chief Economicst at amazon.com:
